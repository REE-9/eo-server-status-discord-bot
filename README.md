# eo-server-status-discord-bot
A discord bot that checks the server status for Endless-Online servers (by default it will check vult-r's but you can monitor any server you want with it... just change the host and or port as needed)

Make a discord server and add the bot to it.
Make the text channel "server-status" so the bot can post to it.
Make sure to give the discord bot all the permissions it will need.

The bot can change its name, picture, status & server picture to reflect the server status.
It will post you updates in the "server-status" text channel. You can edit this obviously and anything else you want to change about it.
You can set your timezone manually which will show your local time and will change the flag that appears when the bot posts an update.

Enjoy.
